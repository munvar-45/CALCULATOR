#DESCRIPTION:

The Calculator program is a simple yet powerful Python-based application developed to perform basic arithmetic operations efficiently. The main purpose of this project is to provide users with a quick and easy way to carry out common calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division without the need for manual computation.

This project was implemented using fundamental Python concepts such as functions, conditional statements (if-elif-else), loops, and user input handling. When the program starts, it presents a menu-driven interface where the user can select the desired operation. The program then takes two numerical inputs from the user, performs the selected calculation, and displays the result instantly.

Error handling is also included to ensure that invalid inputs (such as letters instead of numbers) or errors like division by zero do not crash the program. This improves user experience and makes the calculator more reliable.

While this version is console-based, it can be expanded in the future by adding advanced mathematical functions like exponentiation, square roots, trigonometric operations, or by integrating it into a GUI framework like Tkinter for a more interactive experience.

This project demonstrates a good understanding of Python basics, modular programming through function definitions, and user-friendly output formatting. It also serves as an example of how even a small project can be an important step toward developing more complex software applications.
